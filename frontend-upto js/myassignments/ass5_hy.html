Hyderabad, the capital city of Telangana in India, is a vibrant metropolis 
with a rich history, diverse culture, and stunning architectural landmarks.
 Founded in 1591 by Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah, it derived its name from his
wife, Hyder Mahal. Situated on the banks of the Musi River, Hyderabad
occupies the Deccan Plateau, covering an area of approximately 650 
square kilometers. The city's cultural heritage is a fusion of Hindu,
 Muslim, and Telugu traditions, earning it the title of the "City of
Pearls" due to its historical association with the pearl trade
 . Hyderabad's architectural wonders, such as the iconic Charminar,
Golconda Fort, Qutb Shahi Tombs, and Chowmahalla Palace, stand as
testaments to its glorious past. In recent years, the city has become
  a significant IT and BPO hub, known as "Cyberabad," hosting
  multinational companies, research institutions, and startup
  incubators. Hyderabad's cuisine, the famous Hyderabadi cuisine,
 is a delightful blend of Mughlai, Persian, and Telugu flavors,
 offering iconic dishes that tantalize the taste buds.
